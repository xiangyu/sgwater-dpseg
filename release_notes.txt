Version 1.2.1 -- 1/02/16

This version has some small updates contributed by Antonios
Anastasopoulos which allow the code to compile under newer versions of
g++. There is also a new flag in the Makefile (-std=c++0x) which I
needed to make these work under g++ 4.4.7. Antonios used a different
flag (-std=c++11) which did not work for me but I expect this differs
depending on your compiler and you may need to try both.

Version 1.2 -- 6/05/08

Included in this distribution:
1.  Code and example files for DP and HDP word segmentation models
    (see below and README for additional information).
2.  score_seg.prl, a script for scoring and error analysis
    (see comments at the top of the script for more information).

This version implements full table-tracking in the bigram model
rather than using the Antoniak approximation described in the
ACL 06 paper.  The HDP model is also slightly different in
its handling of utterance boundaries; full details and updated
results can be found on my web site in

A Bayesian Framework for Word Segmentation: Exploring the Effects of
Context.  Sharon Goldwater, Thomas L. Griffiths, and Mark Johnson.
Cognition 112 (1), pp. 21--54. 2009.

Note that results are quite similar to version 1.1, which fixed the
bug in the original implementation, but still used the Antoniak
approximation.  Optimal hyperparameter values are slightly different
than in version 1.1: On the Bernstein-Ratner-Brent data set, the
optimal values are approximately alpha0 = 3000, alpha1 = 100, p# = .2,
p$ = .5.  These values are now the defaults in this program, or can
be set using command-line arguments -a3000, -A100, -b.2, -U.5:

segment -ut -i20000 -a3000 -A100 -b0.2 -U.5 -Iran br-phono.txt

P 75.27 R 69.27 F 72.14 BP 90.71 BR 80.47 BF 85.28 LP 62.81 LR 53.82 LF 57.97

****************************************

Version 1.1 -- 12/12/07

This version is an interim release fixing a bug in the previous version,
but not including several planned changes (see below).

Compilation:

1.  Now compiles under (at least) g++ 3.4, 4.1.  May no longer compile
under 3.3.
2.  Typing "make" now builds the optimized version by default (still
called "segment").

Bug fixes:

I have corrected an implementation bug in which alpha0 was
accidentally used instead of alpha1 in a couple of places.  This bug
only affected the results of the bigram model. The program should now
correctly implement the bigram model described in our ACL 06 paper.
Be aware, however, that since publication we realized that the
approximation we mention for estimating the number of tables assigned
to each word in the bigram model does not take into account the fact
that some words have higher probability under the unigram generator
(P_0) than others.  Thus, it is less accurate than we had previously
believed.

Parameter values/expected results:

Optimal parameter values have changed significantly for the bigram
model.  On the data set used in our ACL paper, the optimal values are
approximately alpha0 = 3000, alpha1 = 300, p# = .2.  These values are
now the defaults in this program, or can be set using command-line
arguments -a3000, -A300, -b.2.  In general, the larger the value of
-A, the fewer boundaries will be inserted.  For a fixed value of -A,
larger values of -a will tend to produce larger lexicon sizes, and
mostly affects lexicon scores.  Here is an example result running with
the following parameter values:

segment -ut -i20000 -a3000 -A300 -b0.2 -Iran br-phono.txt

P 75.71 R 72.07 F 73.84 BP 89.88 BR 83.76 BF 86.72 LP 63.09 LR 50.34 LF 56

Note that these scores are several points lower than the best scores
in the previous (incorrect) version.  Hopefully this doesn't ruin
anyone's day (and I expect if you're trying to do better than us,
you'll be quite pleased).
